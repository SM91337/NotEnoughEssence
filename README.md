# NotEnoughEssence
My first mod for minecraft, needed to tweak essence drops for a (Currently) private modpack.

Massive thanks to [FatherToast](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/members/FatherToast/projects) for being an inspiration and providing me the help needed to make my first mod possible! 

Oh and he makes some awesome mods himself too, go check them out!

Also thanks McJty (I used some of your code too :P), gigaherz, FusionLord, Cypher, Virtuoel and everyone else that provided guidance and input :)
